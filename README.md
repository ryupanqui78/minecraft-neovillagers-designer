# Neo-Villagers - The designer

This mod adds the designer villager that trades decoration items including the blocks added with this mod.

## Workstation
Designer table

## Feature
The Designer table is used to craft items of decoration provided by this mod (Barrel, Chest, Box, Composter, Cauldron). It also serves as a Designer's job site block.

All of its recipes require just one ingredient to produce the block (in different quantities). It allows skipping steps and it is more efficient to craft the blocks. For example a log can directly turned into a Decoration Box; crafting normally this product requires multiple steps and spend more resources.The Designer table is used to craft items of decoration provided by this mod (Barrel, Chest, Box, Composter, Cauldron).
